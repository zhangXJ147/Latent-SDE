# Latent-SDE
This is the official implementation for [Latent-SDE: guiding stochastic differential equations in latent space for unpaired image-to-image translation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40747-024-01566-1).
# Datasets
Please download the AFHQ and CelebA-HQ dataset following the dataset instructions in [https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2) and put them in data/. We also provide some demo images in data/ for quick start.
# Pretrained Models
All used pretrained models can be downloaded from here. Please put them in pretrained_model/. The afhq_dog_4m.pt and celebahq_female_ddpm.pth are the pretrained diffusion models on dog on AFHQ and female on CelebA-HQ respectively, where afhq_dog_4m.pt is provided by ILVR and celebahq_female_ddpm.pth is trained by ourselves based on ddim. cat2dog_dse.pt, wild2dog_dse.pt and male2female_dse.pt are pretrained classifier for domain-specific extractor on cat2dog, wild2dog and male2female task respectively. afhq_dse.pt is the pretrained three-class classifier on AFHQ used for multi-domain translation. 256x256_classifier.pt is the pretrained classifier on ImageNet provided in guided-diffusion used for initial weight of classifier.
